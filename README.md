# Large-Matrix-Multiplication-using-Different-Algorithms
This project aims to multiply very large matrices using different algorithms. The goal of this project is to find the elapsed time for each algorithm while the program is running and to find out algorithm is faster than another. 
It was created in 2019 by me and Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Amer as a project for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at KFUPM. A pdf report and results can be found in the Documents folder.

#### Algorithms used:
- Iterative
- Divide and conquer recursive
- Strassen’s algorithm with base case of n = 1
- Strassen's algorithm with base case of n > 1

#### Use Instructions
- User firistly should enter the number of base case of (n) for 2^n × 2^n
- The two matrics should be together in the input text file.
- User should enter the path of the input text file.
- User should choose one of the four algorithms to run the application.
- Wait until the program finishes.
- An output file will be generated with the result of the multiplication and the elapsed time in seconds.
- You can find our results in the Project Report and Results.pdf
